# Machine Learning methods to detect COVID-19 in a patient

The global pandemic caused by the Corona Virus or COVID-19 has
taken many lives and left others affected in many ways. 
One of the primary reasons for increased deaths is the lack of
proper treatment due to the virus not being detected accurately 
at early stages. This is due to the lack of personnel and other
resources compared to the huge amount of affected patients.
Such pandemic situations or any disease, in general, could be
averted by implementing AI in the medical field. 

Therefore, in this project, we aim to compare and find the best machine learning
algorithm among K-nearest neighbours, Random forest and
Naive Bayes by measuring their accuracies and then develop an AI-driven system
which accurately predicts the presence of COVID in a person 
from the data provided to the model. The data consists of common symptoms
found in a virus-affected patient.
